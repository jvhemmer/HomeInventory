title=[B42] Home Inventory
description=Looted the 14th pipe wrench because you forgot you already had 13? Didn't take that sledgehammer because you already had one but now you realized that was on your previous character? This mod allows you to designate zones in your home(s) or base(s). A list of all items in those zones will be displayed in the new Home Inventory tab, available in the Character Info panel (Health screen).

description=The Home Inventory mod allows the player to create and manage custom zones: "home" zones; similar to how the Animal system works in B42. The items inside home zones are fetched and saved, and can be seen as a list in a new tab called "Home Inventory" located in the Character Info panel (the heart icon). Home zones can cover multiple bases, and can also cover different areas of each base. It's up to you to decide how you will organize your bases and the items inside them.
description=
description=The list of items is only fetched when you add or remove zones, or when you click the "Home Inventory" tab, so the mod has virtually no effect on performance.
description=
description=If you are too far from a zone, the tiles there will not be loaded and the game will think your items don't exist. To prevent this, the mod saves the items of each zone to a cache, so you can keep checking your home inventory while you are away.
